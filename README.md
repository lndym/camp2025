The Swaminarayan faith is a spiritual tradition founded in the early 19th century by Bhagwan Swaminarayan. It emphasizes devotion, moral living, and service to humanity. Followers of this faith strive to live a life of purity, humility, and selflessness, guided by the teachings of their scriptures and spiritual leaders.
